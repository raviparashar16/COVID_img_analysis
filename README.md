# COVID_img_analysis
This project compares a random forest approach to a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for classifying images in a COVID medical image dataset as COVID-infected or not COVID-infected. DataHandler.py code contains a class which helps load the image data in the other code. The RF_Experimentation.py code contains multiple experiments which used different preprocessing methods to capture essential data from the images. A random forest is tuned and trained on the extracted data and classifies test images. The CNN_Experimentation.py code contains a modified Inception V3 neural network which is trained and classifies test images. It was found that the random forest approach is better at classifying using the feature extraction methods on the small dataset than the deep learning approach.
